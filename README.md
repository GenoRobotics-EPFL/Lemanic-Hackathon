# Lemanic-Hackathon

This is working repository for Genorobotic's participation to the Lemanic Life Sciences Hackathon of April 2024. 

## Genorobotics in brief

Genorobotics aims to develop field tools for plant biodiversity identification based on DNA barcoding. This eliminates the need to transport biological samples to labs for testing and aims to support biodiversity conservation efforts.

Four genes are used to identify the species of a sample: matk, trnH-psbA, ITS and rbcL. These genes are amplified through Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and sequenced with an Oxford Nanopore Portable Sequencer.

The goal of the bioinformatics team is to interpret the data generated by the sequencer. First, the raw DNA reads from a fastq file need to be aligned to generate a consensus sequence for each gene. Then, this sequence is compared to NCBI's database of genetic sequences, GenBank with BLASTn. The results of the BLASTn queries for the four genes are put together to predict the species.
